# e-pathy
e-pathy saves integers (also in a file) in a way that you can find them following a path. /0/1/50/0 for example.
Is currently missing a garbage collection, so you cannot delete stuff right now, but the program is done in the way that is appliable.

Compile linux with:

gcc -o e-pathy e-pathy.c
