# e-pathy
e-pathy saves integers (also in a file) in a way that you can find them following a path. /0/1/50/0 for example.
Garbage collection almost done..

The goal of the project is to have an extremely fast research. More shaped as a graph then as a table.

Compile linux with:
gcc -o e-pathy e-pathy.c
