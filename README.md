# e-pathy
e-pathy saves integers (also in a file) in a way that you can find them following a path. /0/1/50/0 for example.
e-pathy is a database shaped as a graph, where you can navigate throught paths and save data in branches, or create other branches in branches.

The goal of the project is to have an extremely fast research, and save memory.

Garbage collection almost done..

Compile linux with: gcc -o e-pathy e-pathy.c
