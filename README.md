# e-pathy
e-pathy saves integers (also in a file) in a way that you can find them following a path. /0/1/50/0 for example.
Is currently missing a garbage collection, so you cannot delete stuff right now, but the program is done in the way that is appliable.

The goal of the project is to have an extremely fast research, more shaped as a graph then as a table.

Compile linux with:
gcc -o e-pathy e-pathy.c
