# e-pathy
e-pathy saves integers (also in a file) in a way that you can find them following a path. /0/1/50/0 for example.
It is a database shaped as a graph, where you can navigate throught paths and save data or other brances.

Garbage collection almost done..

The goal of the project is to have an extremely fast research, and save memory.

Compile linux with: gcc -o e-pathy e-pathy.c
